# Alternate State Actions

This extension gets the user two buttons which he/she will need to 
work with Alternate States in Qlik Sen
se: 
* A "Copy From Main State" button and 
* A "Clear Alternate State" button. 
 
Labels and styles can be changed. 

The developer also needs my other extension to introduce the Alternate States first
and to assign objects to such a State (http://branch.qlik.com/#project/569368a0fe261eb8649bf582).
